answer 2 - A model relationship propagates filters applied on the column of one model table to a different model table. Filters will propagate so long as there's a relationship path to follow, which can involve propagation to multiple tables.
Relationship paths are deterministic, meaning that filters are always propagated in the same way and without random variation. Relationships can, however, be disabled, or have filter context modified by model calculations that use particular DAX functions.

ANSWER 3 - ORM IS a way to align programming code with database structures. ORM uses metadata descriptors to create a layer between the programming language and a relational database. It thus connects object-oriented program (OOP) code with the database and simplifies the interaction between relational databases and OOP languages.
The idea of ORM is based on abstraction. The ORM mechanism makes it possible to address, access and manipulate objects without having to consider how those objects relate to their data sources. ORM lets programmers maintain a consistent view of objects over time, even as the sources that deliver them, the sinks that receive them and the applications that access them change.
