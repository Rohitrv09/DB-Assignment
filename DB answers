answer 1 - It depends on your requirements, what you expect to do with the data, and if it has sense that "model" and "product_category" can be strong entities on their own. For example, in normal conditions, I will assume that "product_category" is a strong entity... Why? My answer is that you can have product categories even if you don't have products for such categories. 
Another reason to make it a strong entity could be reporting or making searches about product categories (It will be more easy for a database engine to list all "product categories" by searching a small table, instead of iterating for all available products to gather all their categories)
